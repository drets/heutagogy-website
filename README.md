# Getting started
We have a continuous deployment system, which is used for testing all system components. Don't expect it to be stable, though we try to keep it so.

1. Sign up on [the Heutagogy backend](https://heutagogy.herokuapp.com/user/register).
   Use the following server address when you are asked for one: `https://heutagogy.herokuapp.com`.

2. Install [Heutagogy Google Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/heutagogy/dcjclncadeblkbflledfnlldlidmjnhj).
   The extension allows saving links to web pages and marking them as read.

3. Use [the Heutagogy frontend](https://app.heutagogy.io/) to check your saved pages.
